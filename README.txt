#Auravana

This is an open source Stingray repository for simulating and optimizing a set of circular integrated city systems for our community (The Auravana Project and The Zeitgeist Movement). 

This repository contains the assets and levels necessary to recreate the project in Autodesk Stingray. 
Place the .level files in the .../content/levels folder, and place the City-Aura folder in the .../content/models folder. 

This project is setup for the HTC Vive.
